site_template
=============

This file started off as "A basic website template I have created to base websites I create off of." but there have been many additions since then. It now has a setup file which will walk through many of tedious time consuming tasks, such as creating directories and removing git files.

## Setup

Simply start the `setup` script (in bash) and it will walk you through getting all the basics of your site set up.
